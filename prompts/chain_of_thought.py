Problem: If a train travels at 60 mph for 2.5 hours, how far does it travel?

Solution:
Let me break this down:
Step 1: Identify what we know
- Speed = 60 miles per hour
- Time = 2.5 hours

Step 2: Recall the formula
- Distance = Speed × Time

Step 3: Calculate
- Distance = 60 mph × 2.5 hours
- Distance = 150 miles

Therefore, the train travels 150 miles.

LOGICAL_COT_EXAMPLE = """Let's analyze this logical problem carefully.

Problem: All cats are mammals. Some mammals are pets. Can we conclude that all cats are pets?

Analysis:
First, let me identify the key elements:
- Premise 1: All cats are mammals (cats ⊆ mammals)
- Premise 2: Some mammals are pets (mammals ∩ pets ≠ ∅)
- Conclusion to evaluate: All cats are pets (cats ⊆ pets)?

Let me think through this:
1. From Premise 1: Every cat is definitely a mammal
2. From Premise 2: At least one mammal is a pet, but not all mammals need to be pets
3. The premises don't tell us anything specific about cats and pets

The logical fallacy here is:
- Just because cats are mammals, and some mammals are pets
- Doesn't mean that cats specifically are in the "pet" subset of mammals

Conclusion: No, we CANNOT conclude that all cats are pets. This is a logical fallacy known as "undistributed middle."

Debugging process:
1. First, I'll understand what the code is trying to do:
   - It's calculating the average of a list of numbers
   - Sums all numbers, then divides by count

2. Let me trace through with the given input []:
   - numbers = [] (empty list)
   - total = 0 (loop doesn't execute)
   - len(numbers) = 0
   - total / len(numbers) = 0 / 0 = ERROR!

3. Root cause identified:
   - The function doesn't handle empty lists
   - Division by zero when list is empty
